\chapter*{Preface}

Hello world.

Biomechanics is the study of motion and how it affects biological systems. It's a discipline at the interface of evolutionary biology, developmental biology, materials science, engineering, physics, and mathematics. Integrating methodology from so many different disciplines, each with their unique lingo for the same ideas, can be confusing. We aim to provide a crash course in the methods used to study much of biomechanics, with an optional explanation of how each was derived, and ultimately to show how biomechanics can be used to answer questions meaningful to evolutionary, ecological, or medical study.
