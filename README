How to compile:  
1.  Run pdfLaTeX on main.tex 
2.  Run bibtex on main.tex
3.  Run bibtex on each chapter file (e.g. ch-solids.tex) that you have changed or worked on.
4.  Run pdfLaTeX twice.
5.  Run makeindex on main.tex
6.  Run pdfLaTeX twice. 

Perhaps there is some way to make a Make file that will just do this all automatically?
