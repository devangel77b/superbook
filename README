How to compile:  
1.  Run pdfLaTeX on main.tex 
2.  Run bibtex on main.tex
3.  Run bibtex on each chapter file (e.g. ch-solids.tex) that you have changed or worked on.
4.  Run pdfLaTeX twice.
5.  Run makeindex on main.tex
6.  Run pdfLaTeX twice. 

Perhaps there is some way to make a Make file that will just do this all automatically?  





Revision control and syncing using Mercurial
1. After making edits, commit your changes using:  hg commit -m "Enter a useful comment here."
2. To push your changes to the repository, use: hg push
3. To pull changes from the repository, use: hg pull, then hg update
4. To clone the repository using ssh, for example:
hg clone ssh:\\hg@bitbucket.org\devangel77b\superbook





Revision control block on top of tex file
Do not edit this.  After committing changes (hg commit -m "Made some changes"), update the block using the following:

2.  hg kwexpand
